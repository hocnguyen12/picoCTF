# The numbers solution

numbers : `16 9 3 15 3 20 6` and `20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14`

We can guess that the 7 first number spell "picoCTF", looking at them we can see that they represent their order in the alphabet (a = 1, b = 2, ...)

`script.py` does the conversion and prints the flag.

output: `flag : picoCTF{thenumbersmason}`

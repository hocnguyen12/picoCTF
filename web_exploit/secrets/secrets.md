# Secrets Solution/Writeup

I was given the `http://saturn.picoctf.net:61824/` domain to investigate.

Looking at source html with the inspector (ctrl + shift + k in firefox), in the `head` tag, I found :
```html
<link href="secret/assets/index.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Which indicates the existence of a `secret` directory on the server. 

Looking at `http://saturn.picoctf.net:61824/secret/index.html` we find an html page with "Finally. You almost found me. you are doing well".

Again, looking at the `head` tag, there is :
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="hidden/file.css">
```
indicating the existence of a subdirectory `secret/hidden`.

We now look at `http://saturn.picoctf.net:61824/secret/hidden/index.html` and find an html page with a login screen.

The login doesn't work and we don't easily have access to correct credentials.

By looking once again at the source html, in the `head` tag, we find another subdirectory :
```html
<link href="superhidden/login.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
We arrive to the final html page at `http://saturn.picoctf.net:61824/secret/hidden/superhidden/index.html`

And we find the flag in the html (which is not visible on the screen): `<h3 class="flag">picoCTF{succ3ss_@h3n1c@10n_790d2615}</h3>`

FLAG : `picoCTF{succ3ss_@h3n1c@10n_790d2615}`
